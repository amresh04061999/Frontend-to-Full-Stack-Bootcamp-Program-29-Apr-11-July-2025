What are HTTP Methods?
HTTP methods define how a client (like a browser or app) communicates with a server to perform actions like retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting resources.

🔹 1. GET
Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.
Request Body: ❌ Not allowed
Use Case: Fetch user details, get a product list.

Example:
GET /users/123
Effect: Does not change data — it only reads.

🔹 2. POST
Purpose: Create a new resource on the server.
Request Body: ✅ Required (with data)
Use Case: Register a new user, submit a form.

Example:
POST /users
Body: { "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }
Effect: Creates a new item.

🔹 3. PUT
Purpose: Update a resource entirely (full replacement).
Request Body: ✅ Required (complete object)
Use Case: Update all fields of a user profile.

Example:
PUT /users/123
Body: { "name": "John", "email": "newemail@example.com" }
Effect: Replaces the entire resource with the provided data.

🔹 4. PATCH
Purpose: Partially update an existing resource.
Request Body: ✅ Required (only changed fields)
Use Case: Update only the email of a user.

Example:
PATCH /users/123
Body: { "email": "newemail@example.com" }
Effect: Updates only specific fields.

🔹 5. DELETE
Purpose: Delete an existing resource from the server.
Request Body: ❌ Usually not needed
