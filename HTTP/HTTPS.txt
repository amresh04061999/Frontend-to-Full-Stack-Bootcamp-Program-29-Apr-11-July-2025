 1. What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
It is a protocol used for transferring data (like HTML pages, images, videos) between a web browser (client) and a web server.
It works on port 80 by default.
Itâ€™s stateless, meaning it does not remember previous interactions.
It is based on request-response:
Client (browser) sends a request
Server sends back a response
ðŸ“Œ Example:
When you type http://example.com, your browser makes an HTTP request to the server and displays the webpage.

ðŸ”¹ 2. What is HTTPS?
HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure.
It is the secure version of HTTP.
Uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data.
Works on port 443.
Ensures data privacy, integrity, and authentication.
ðŸ“Œ Example:
When you access https://gmail.com, all your data (email, password) is encrypted and secure during transmission.
